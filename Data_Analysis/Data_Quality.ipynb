    "Accuracy: The dataset is accurate. When checking for any syntax errors within the Line Column, which we are primarily merging on, there were no misspellings and no duplicates.There were no discrepancies in accords to the “ground truth”\n",
    "\n",
    "Completeness: The dataset has no missing rows, except the first row for each train line for each day (either weekend or weekday) always starts off with a blank under the Reporting Category Col and a 0 in the incidents column. While this is intentional and not an indicator of missing data, it is still something to be aware of. \n",
    "\n",
    "Timeliness: According to the Data.NY.Gov website, this dataset was just recently updated on October 24, 2025. It seems like they are frequently updating it. Both the data and the meta data were uploaded on the same day. The dataset provides content for each line for each month starting from 01-01-20. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: The dataset is consistent. Under the Reporting Category, there are 6 options to choose from and no other variations so it is easy to categorize the types of incidents. While these 6 options help with consistency, it does limit true understanding of what the detailed true incident is. The other columns are consistent as well: The Month column follows the same syntax of Year-Month-Day, the Division column only has options from A Division or B Division, the Line column only contains numbers or letters of real train lines in the MTA, and the Incidents column only has numbers.  \n",

Although it is not as frequent as the other datasets, it is not relevant in our case because we are only looking at 2024 data for our research questions and there is data for each month for each line in this dataset. \n",

    "Consistency: The dataset is consistent. The Month column follows the same syntax of Year-Month-Day, the Line column only contains numbers or letters of real train lines in the MTA,  the Division column only has options from A Division or B Division, the Period column only has options from Peak or Offpeak, and the Num_passengers column only has numbers, columns Additional Platform Time, Additional Train Time, Total_apt, Total_att, and Over_five_mins are all in minutes, and the Over_five_mins_perc and Customer journey time performance columns are all in percentages.
