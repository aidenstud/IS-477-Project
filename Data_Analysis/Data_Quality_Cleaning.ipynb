    "\n",
    "Accuracy: Amongst all 6 columns, the columns were both syntactically and semantically accurate. We validated the “ground truth” relationships between the division and line columns, confirming that every subway line listed exists in the real NYC subway system and is correctly assigned to its division. All incident counts were non-negative, the \"day_type\" column correctly used only the two valid categories (weekday = 1, weekend = 2), and all \"reporting_category\" values matched the definitions provided in the data dictionary. Overall, there were no discrepancies according to the “ground truth”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Completeness: The dataset had 538 rows containing missing data. This was because the first row for each train line for each day (either weekend or weekday) always starts off with a blank under the Reporting Category Col and a 0 in the incidents column. While this is intentional and not an indicator of missing data, it is still something to be aware of. \n",
    "\n",
    "Timeliness: According to the Data.NY.Gov website, this dataset was just recently updated on October 24, 2025. As stated in documentation, this dataset is updated each month. Both the data and the meta data were uploaded on the same day. The dataset provides content for each line for each month starting from 20-01-01. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: The dataset is consistent. Under the Reporting Category, there are 6 options to choose from and no other variations so it is easy to categorize the types of incidents. While these 6 options help with consistency, it does limit true understanding of what actual incident is. The other columns are consistent as well: The Month column follows the same syntax of Year-Month-Day, the Division column only has options from A Division or B Division, the Line column only contains numbers or letters of real train lines in the MTA, and the Incidents column only has numbers.

    "Accuracy: The dataset is accurate. Amongst all 12 columns, the columns were both syntactically and semantically accurate.  We validated the “ground truth” relationships between the division and line columns, confirming that every subway line listed exists in the real NYC subway system and is correctly assigned to its division. We also checked that the \"period\" column correctly used only the two valid categories (peak or offpeak), that all numeric columns were contextually valid (even in cases where values were negative), and made sure each followed the same syntax (such as the month column Year-Month-Day).
