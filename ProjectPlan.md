# IS477 Project

**Overview:**

New York City is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with millions of people relying on public transportation every day to get to work, school, and other destinations. Because of this, reliable public transit is crucial -- even the smallest delays can throw someone off course, and put them behind schedule. For this project, we will specifically be focusing on the MTA subway delays in 2024, analyzing patterns, causes, and passenger impacts to improve subway reliability and passenger experience. 

**Research Question(s):**

What are the most common delays? Do they occur often? 

Which train line has the most delays? Is the cause for the delay the same each time? Are delays frequent? 

Which train line (delays) have the longest wait times? 

Do peak (rush-hour) riders experience more delays than non-peak riders? Are wait times longer peak vs non-peak?

Which months (in 2024) had the worst customer experience overall, such as longer wait times? 

Do planned maintenance activities (Planned ROW Work delays) correspond to improved service delivered in later months?

**Dataset(s):**

We will be working with 4 datasets, all coming from the New York State government website.

Dataset 1: Our primary dataset will be “MTA Subway Trains Delayed: Beginning 2020”. This dataset is organized by month, with each month (row) giving the reason for delays on each train line, whether the delays occurred on a weekday or weekend, and how many times each delay happened within the month.

Dataset 2: "MTA Subway Customer Journey-Focused Metrics: 2020-2024”. This dataset is organized by month, with each month (row) giving us the number of passengers, various wait time metrics, and peak vs non-peak rush hour periods for each train line.  This dataset will be integrated with our primary dataset to show the relationship between delays and wait times for each train line. 

Dataset 3: “MTA Subway Service Delivered: 2020-2024”. This dataset is organized by month, with each month (row) comparing how many trains were scheduled vs how many trains actually showed up during the weekday vs weekends. This dataset will be integrated with our primary dataset to see which trainlines are most reliable even if delays occur. 

Dataset 4: “MTA Service Alerts: Beginning April 2020”.This dataset is organized by date and records which train lines experienced delays, the content of the public service announcements for each delay, and how many times passengers were updated. This dataset will be integrated with our primary dataset to provide detailed insights into delays since the primary dataset groups “reasons for delays” into six broad categories.
